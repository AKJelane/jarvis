Jarvis Tutorial

Here you will find the Jarvis tutorial project that uses a mix of DialogFlow, Web Speech API and other libraries such as BotUI to bring Jarvis to the web, for free, for everyone.

Credit goes to the respective API creators.

NOTES

Installing Node.js can be confusing, frustrating and time consuming so I suggest you search 'install node.js on Windows/OSX/Linux'

This will only work in Chrome as it uses Google Speech Recognition

To run this:

On Windows Powershell : 
    1. Set-Location YOUR-DIRECTORY-PATH-FOR-NODEJS/JARVIS
    2. node app.js
    
On Linux : 
    1. cd YOUR-DIRECTORY-PATH-FOR-NODEJS/JARVIS
    2. node app.js
